**Brain Tumor Classification using a Pre-trained CNN**
This repository contains the code for a brain tumor classification system that uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the "Brain Tumor MRI Images 44 Classes" dataset.

**Description**
This project aims to accurately classify different types of brain tumors from MRI scans. By leveraging a pre-trained CNN, the model can achieve high accuracy with less training time. This README will guide you through setting up and using this project.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the "Brain Tumor MRI Images 44 Classes" dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. It contains a collection of T1, contrast-enhanced T1, and T2 MRI images of brain tumors.

**Model**
This project uses a pre-trained ResNet50] model for feature extraction and classification. The final layers of the model were fine-tuned on the brain tumor dataset to adapt it to the specific task of tumor classification.
